# minimap-shader
A minecraft shader that adds a minimap to the game

It features entity radar, a flashing warning for ghasts and ancient debris, options for rotating and top-north view and a cave mode.

This shader was originally a project to help me wrap my head around voxelisation, but it became its own thing.
